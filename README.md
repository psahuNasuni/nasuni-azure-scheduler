# Description

The NAC Scheduler extends the capabilities of the [Nasuni Analytics Connector](https://nac.cs.nasuni.com/) (NAC) by automatically exporting a volume in native object format, and then scheduling Azure services to run against the data on a periodic basis. For details of operating the Nasuni Analytics Connector, see [Nasuni Analytics Connector Azure](https://b.link/Nasuni_Analytics_Connector_AZURE).

The NAC Scheduler is a configuration script that:
* Deploys a Azure VM, that acts as a scheduler of the Nasuni Analytics Connector.
* Creates a custom Azure function for indexing data into an Azure Cognitive Search service.
* It also, creates a simple UI for accessing that service.
 
There is an AI enabled Azure Cognitive Search service that the NAC Scheduler currently supports: [Azure Cognitive Search Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/cognitive-search#overview). Each deployment is started with a single command-line script that takes at most five arguments, and can deploy an entire system with one command.

* [Cognitive Search Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/cognitive-search#overview) is a cloud search service that gives developers infrastructure, APIs, and tools for building a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

    CognitiveSearch enables people to easily ingest (i.e. ingestion, parsing, and storing of textual content and tokens that populate a search index.), secure, search, aggregate, view, and analyze data. These capabilities are popular for use cases such as application search, log analytics, and more. With CognitiveSearch, people benefit from having an AI enabled Free-form text search that provide a secure, high-quality search and analytics suite with a rich roadmap of new and innovative functionality.

# Prerequisites

To install the NAC Scheduler, you need the following:

1. The [Azure command line tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/), wget, [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), curl, dos2unix and [git] installed on a computer that is able to connect to the Azure Location in which you choose to deploy the NAC.
To install the above dependencies/prerequisite tools; you can execute the install_packages.sh file which is available in this repository.
```sh
./install_packages.sh
```
2. An Azure subscription with Administrator permissions.
3. ServicePrincipal with owner access . Example: nac_sp_user
4. Confirm that you have access to create and manage following services: 
    Azure Cognitive Search Service, Azure Function App, Application Configurations, Azure KeyVault, Azure Storage Account and Application Insights.    
5. Azure Storage account Container.
    Upload the NAC Volume key (.pgp file) in the "Volume key container". Upload to the [Analytics Connector] the encryption keys for the volume that you want to search, via the NAC’s Volume Encryption Key Export page. 
    
    If you are using encryption keys generated internally by the Nasuni Edge Appliance, you can export (download) your encryption keys with the Nasuni Edge Appliance. For details, see “Downloading (Exporting) Generated Encryption Keys” on page 379 of the [Nasuni Edge Appliance Administration Guide](https://b.link/Nasuni_Edge_Appliance_Administration_Guide). 
If you have escrowed your key with Nasuni and do not have it in your possession, contact Nasuni Support.
6. A Nasuni Edge Appliance with Web Access enabled on the volume that is being searched.

# Installation

## Quick Start

1. Sign in to Azure CLI using a service principal

2. Download the script NAC Scheduler from this repository, or clone this repository.

3. Make the NAC Scheduler script executable on your computer (i.e. Linux Jump box). For example, you can run this command:
```sh 
chmod 755 NAC_Scheduler.sh
```

4. Run the NAC Scheduler script with at least four arguments:
    * The name of the volume.
    * The name of the service to be integrated with (i.e. acs).
    * The frequency of the indexing (in minutes).
    * The name of the user input Vault used.
    
For example, a command like this:

```sh 
./NAC_Scheduler.sh Projects acs 300 my-secret-vault
```

When the script has completed, you will see a URL.

    5. Choose a name for your key. Remember this name for when you run the initial script.  

    **Create a local file**

    1. Create a text file that contains the key/value pairs listed above.
    2. Do not use quotes for either the key or the value. For example: azure-location="canadacentral"
    3. Save this as a text file (for example, mysecret.txt) in the same folder as the NAC_Scheduler.sh script.

4. If you need to override any of the NAC parameters (as described in the Appendix: Automating Analytics Connector section of the [NAC Technical Documentation]), you can create a NAC variables file that lists the parameters you would like to change.

5. Save this list of variables as a text file (for example, nacvariables.txt) in the same folder as the NAC_Scheduler.sh script.

6. Run the script with three to five arguments, depending on whether or not you have created a local secrets file or a NAC variables file. The order of arguments should be as follows:
    * The name of the volume.
    * The name of the service to be integrated with (see Services Available below).
    * The frequency of the indexing (in minutes).
    * The path to the secrets file created in Step 3 **Create via Azure Portal**, or the name of the User Input Vault generated in Step 3 **Create a local file**.
    * (OPTIONAL) The path to the NAC variables file.

For example, a command with all five arguments would look like this:

```sh
./NAC_Scheduler.sh Projects acs 300 my-secret-vault nacvariables.txt
```
